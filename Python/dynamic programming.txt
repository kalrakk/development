In computer science, mathematics, management science, 
economics and bioinformatics, dynamic programming 
(also known as dynamic optimization) is a method for solving 
a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of 
simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just
 once, and storing their solutions.
