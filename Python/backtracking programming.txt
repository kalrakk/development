Recur­sion is the key in back­track­ing pro­gram­ming.
 As the name sug­gests we back­track to find the solu­tion.
 We start with one pos­si­ble move out of many avail­able 
moves and try to solve the prob­lem if we are able to solve 
the prob­lem with the selected move then we will print the 
solu­tion else we will back­track and select some other move 
and try to solve it. If none if the moves work out we will claim 
that there is no solu­tion for the problem.
